## [Page] Service 1: Executive AI Briefing (service1.html)

### Hero
**Title:** Executive AI Briefing
**Intro:** A private, 2-hour strategy session for leaders who refuse to let the biggest technological shift in history happen *to* them.

### The Reality Check
AI is shifting the landscape of every industry. The goal of this session is not to sell you a product, but to provide the **clarity and context** you need to navigate this shift. We help you understand what is possible, what is hype, and where the genuine opportunities lie for your specific business.

### The Agenda (2-Hour Deep Dive)
**Part I: The Landscape**
*Understanding the Core Concepts.* We start by building a shared vocabulary. You'll gain a clear, non-technical understanding of Generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Autonomous Agents. We explain *how* they work so you can understand *what* they can do.

**Part II: Industry Scope**
*Market & Competitor Analysis.* We look outward. How are other leaders in your sector leveraging AI? We discuss relevant use cases, emerging trends, and the "art of the possible" within your specific vertical.
